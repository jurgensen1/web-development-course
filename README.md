# Web Development Course 
This is a structured collection of free resources — YouTube videos — used in the author's self-directed, web development bootcamp, which is still underway. 
It is structured in a fairly standard way: it will have both front-end and back-end topics.  

It will probably go beyond and into more advanced topics, but for now the author is learning the basics.  
In addition, the author's follow-along work and self-directed-application work will be exhibited.

## In no particular order here are all the topics the author wants to cover:

### Front-End Topics
HTML  
CSS  
JavaScript  
Web APIs

### Back End Topics:
